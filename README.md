# PySnakeReinforcedLearning

Implementation of the classic Snake game with Reinforced Learning that I wrote while studying for the Machine Learning Exam during my Master in AI at USI.

I used Bellman's Optimality Equation for Markov Decision Processes and Value Iteration algorithm to obtain an optimal deterministic policy after each move.

To learn about RL I greatly recommend the book: Reinforced Learning, an Introduction by Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G. Barto.


**HOW TO PLAY:**

-Arrow keys or WASD to move.

-P or M to increase/decrease game speed


**ACTIVATE RL:**

-Press R to toggle cool RL Bot.

-Press Y to just "win" the game with a pretty dumb but very effective RL Bot that has no reward for getting food.
